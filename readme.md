# Home Automation Using Single Board Computers

### This project was created and developed for my semester's mini project submission and hence the repo name 

---
## __Requirements__

The Project only requires `Packet Tracer` for its operation

__Packet Tracer Version__ <br>
> Minimum : `>7.1` <br>
`This is the version that introduced IoT and Arduino Simulation to PT and hence is base minimum `

> Recommended : `8.2.1`<br> 
`The Project was developed in this Version of Packet Tracer and hence has high chances of working`
